*"The security framework of the God Of Thunder"*

oAuThor is a security framework created for experimenting with the OAuth 2.0 flows. The goal is to design an 
Authorization Server capable of managing Server-side Web Application Flows (Authorization code grant in the RFC). The
system will provide:

* Resource Owner Management: 
* Access control based on bearer tokens with a resource proxy.
* Authorization server, capable of: managing resource owner grants and authorization codes and creation and management of bearer tokens.
